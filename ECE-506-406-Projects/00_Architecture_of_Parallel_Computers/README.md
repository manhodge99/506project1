# Architecture Of Parallel Computers ECE 506 Material

This repository holds all supplementary material for the ECE 506 course.

## Course Description

The need for parallel and massively parallel computers. Taxonomy of parallel computer architecture, and programming models for parallel architectures. Example parallel algorithms. Shared-memory vs. distributed-memory architectures. Correctness and performance issues. Cache coherence and memory consistency. Bus-based and scalable directory-based multiprocessors. Interconnection-network topologies and switch design. Brief overview of advanced topics such as multiprocessor pre-fetching and speculative parallel execution. Credit is not allowed for more than one course in this set: ECE 506.

## Please note the following

* **It is recommended to always to go back to the book as a reference.**
    * (NEW) Fundamentals of Parallel Multi-core Architecture (Chapman & Hall/CRC Computational Science) 1st Edition-2015 by Yan Solihin (Author).
    * Fundamentals of Parallel Computer Architecture Paperback-2009 by Yan Solihin (Author).
* For now this repository is for FALL 2018 Class any future updates are the responsibility of future TAs if they want to use it.
* This framework developed on Ubuntu-Linux. It is your responsibility to make it work on windows or other systems, though it will run on any Linux machine that has a terminal.
